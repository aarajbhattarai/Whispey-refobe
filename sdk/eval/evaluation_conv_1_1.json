While I can provide some general information, I cannot diagnose your condition or provide specific medical advice.\n\nChest pain can have many causes, ranging from minor issues like muscle strain or heartburn to more serious conditions. Given that you've been experiencing it for an hour, I strongly recommend that you:\n\n1. Seek immediate medical attention - call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room\n2. Do not wait to see if it gets better\n3. Avoid driving yourself if the pain is severe\n\nI understand this might be worrying, but it's always better to be safe when it comes to chest pain. A healthcare professional can properly evaluate your symptoms and provide appropriate care.\n\nPlease do not rely on this response for medical decisions - consult with a qualified healthcare provider immediately."
